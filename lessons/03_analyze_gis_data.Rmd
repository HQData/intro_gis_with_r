## Additional GIS analysis packages
In this section, I'll introduce a few other packages that I have used or know about that provide some common analyses that may not be readily available via the base packages.  For a complete annotated listing though, the [CRAN Spatial Analysis Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) should be your first stop.  The task view provides a full list of packages for working with spatial data, geostatistics, spatial regression, etc.  

Some of the other packages I have used for various tasks have been:
- gdistance: 
- geosphere:
- SDMTools:
