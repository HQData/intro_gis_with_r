# Basic GIS Analysis with R
We now have the required packages installed and know how to read data into R. Our next step is to start doing some GIS analysis with R. Throughout the course of this lesson will show how to do some basic manipulation of the `raster` and `sp` objects.

## Other Geospatial packages
In this section, I'll introduce a few other packages that I have used or know about that provide some common analyses that may not be readily available via the base packages.  For a complete annotated listing though, the [CRAN Spatial Analysis Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) should be your first stop.  The task view provides a full list of packages for working with spatial data, geostatistics, spatial regression, etc.  

Some of the other packages I have used for various tasks have been:
- gdistance: 
- geosphere:
- SDMTools:
