#Introduction to GIS with R

This 1/2 day workshop will provide attendees with an introduction to doing basic GIS analyses using the R Language for Statistical Computing.  After attending this workshop, you will be able to:

- get all appropriate software and packages installed and running
- know how read in a variety of vector and raster spatial data formats
- know how to conduct some basic spatial analyses
- use a variety of approaches for visualizing spatial data with R
- know how and where to get help

##Pre-requisites
It is expected that you have some familiarity with R and RStudio, can install packages from CRAN, and understand basic R syntax.

##Software
We will be using R and RStudio for this workshop.  This must be installed prior to March 2.  Simply email EZTech and request that R and RStudio be installed on your machine.  They will push that out usually in a day or so.
